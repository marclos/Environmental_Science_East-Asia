On April 4th, 2018 off the coast of the island of Borneo an oil spill engulfing much of the East Asian sea sweep Indonesia making it go on a state of emergency. Southeast Asia's abundance of temperate rainforest make it even more important to mitigate hazardous air pollution in the region. Air pollution is seen in Indonesia with the sizeable burning of land systems contributing to record high air hazards each year. The movement of CO2 in Southeast Asia activity show shifts in the regions 

Research on CO and CO2 concentration have shown high activity increase in the southern and northern Indian ocean. The increase was from approximately 50 ppbv in southern hemisphere to >120 ppbv north of the equator. CO findings also report as high as 200 ppbv near coastal India. We can also see relative aersoal mass in ozone levels indicating common transport and source for CO as well. \citep{phadnis2002evolution}
